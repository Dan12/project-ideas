# Project Ideas

## USB software driven ISP
- you just need VCC, GND, Reset and 3 data pins (spi) to emulate ISP
- is there a simple circuit that could interperet a 2 line usb signal into 6 lines?
- 1st real lead: https://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=22987.0

## Online Music Creator (based on online launchpad)
- started planning: https://github.com/Dan12/music-editor

## Image editing software
- encourages creation of plugins to add effects to images by implementing certain algorithms

## Running pace predictor
- uses existing data to advise a pace for a certain distance
- gets better the more you input your running data
- ml project, which algorithm (SVM?)

## Simple and easy mathematical proof notation guide
- union, and, or, implies, if ... then ... , etc.
- truth tables

## Simple online creator for code uml diagrams
- example: http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/rational/library/08/1202_berfeld/image003.jpg

## Comception: computer inside computer
- defines basic electronic components like AND, OR, and NOT logic gates, Flip-Flops, Memory units, ect.
- goal to use the application to simulate and program an 8-bit computer inside a browser

## Drag an drop ML algorithm creator? already exists?

## Distributed front end DB
- no back end
- use js localstorage for long term
- connect to database that you trust if sensative information
- browser sessions must be able to talk to each other with no back end. Possible?
