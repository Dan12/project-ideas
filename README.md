# Project Ideas

## Programming language based around touch screens.

## Chrome extension to troubleshoot arduinos and advise on fixes

## Reprogram arduino without additional ISP board
- there is already a 8u2 or 16u2 usb to serial board
  - modify to use usb to serial and usb to ISP?
- 1st real lead: https://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=22987.0
- overwrite 16u2 firmware: https://github.com/NicoHood/HoodLoader2

## Online Music Creator (based on online launchpad)
- started planning: https://github.com/Dan12/music-editor

## Image editing software
- encourages creation of plugins to add effects to images by implementing certain algorithms

## Running pace predictor
- uses existing data to advise a pace for a certain distance
- gets better the more you input your running data
- ml project, which algorithm (SVM?)

## Simple and easy mathematical proof notation guide
- union, and, or, implies, if ... then ... , etc.
- truth tables

## Simple online creator for code uml diagrams
- example: http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/rational/library/08/1202_berfeld/image003.jpg

## Comception: computer inside computer
- defines basic electronic components like AND, OR, and NOT logic gates, Flip-Flops, Memory units, ect.
- goal to use the application to simulate and program an 8-bit computer inside a browser

## Drag an drop ML algorithm creator? already exists?

## Distributed front end DB
- no back end
- use js localstorage for long term
- connect to database that you trust if sensative information
- browser sessions must be able to talk to each other with no back end. Possible?

## Giant botnet using BeepBoop
- create new github
- setup general code with webhooks
- one script as master, everyone else as slaves, domination.
- automate with github scraping?
